To get started with the Docusaurus documentation project, follow these steps:

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the root of your repository and install the project's dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

2.  **Build for Production**: After installing dependencies, you can build the static site for deployment. The output will be located in the `build` directory.
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```

3.  **Deploy**: The `build` directory contains the static assets of your Docusaurus site. These can be deployed to any static site hosting service (e.g., GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel). The deployment process typically involves pushing the contents of the `build` directory to your chosen hosting platform.

Please ensure you run these commands from the root directory of your project, where `package.json` is located.
